# Collection of 3rd year student final projects codes (Processing and Arduino mainly)

As instructors of 3rd year Visual Communication Design Studio - Interaction Design and Physical Computing we started collecting the final works of the students with the following aims:
- archive purpose
- reuse
- diffusion

## Getting Started

Each project might have very different requirements and adopt different platforms. Check the readme first.

### Prerequisites

Generally Processing and Arduino are the essential requirement but we might add libraries and related content links to facilitate setup.

<!-- ### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
